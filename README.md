# Fooly Functional ToDo

A todo list coded with Elm. Built purely to explore how Elm works and what it can do.

## Setup

To see the component's functionality all you need to do is navigate to the directory and run ```elm reactor```. If you would like to see the component with some very quick styling, simply run ```elm make src/Main.elm --output html/elm.js``` and this will compile the Elm code to JS.  This can then be viewed by opening ```html/index.html```, where the JS is embedded.
